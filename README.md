## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run the code here, beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python, we also need to install wordcloud library.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to better understand:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
2. What factors might influence the probability of a listing being booked?  
3. What are different neighborhoods' characteristics?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
